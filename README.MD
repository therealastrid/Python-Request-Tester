# Python Request Tester
I needed a way to test the average response time of my API Applications so i made this script, you can pass some routes in as JSON files and it will test it x times and give a result.

### How to use?
Rename ``routes_example`` to ``routes`` and rename ``request.json.example`` to ``request.json`` and modify, then run with ``python3 run.py request``
